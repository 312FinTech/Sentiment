CMP Indicator (Current Market Psychology) Indicator

In Part I, we will put on LSTM RNN Model hat to predict S&P 500 closing prices. We will also fetch and analyze today's business sentiments leveraging today's top business headlines.


In Part II, we will switch and put on Random Forest model hat to predict recession. We will then, if needed, move our GradientBoostingClassifier wand to add some sparkle to our model accuracy. Finally, we will leverage Random Forest feature importance segment to create Fear and Greed Index to gauge the pulse of current market psychology and showcase our results using Panel.
